# Voice-to-Text Desktop App (Tauri + Deepgram)

A cross-platform desktop application that converts speech into text using a push-to-talk workflow.  
Built as a functional clone of **Wispr Flow**, focusing on core voice-to-text functionality rather than UI polish.

This project demonstrates practical skills in building AI-powered desktop applications using **Tauri**, **React**, and **Deepgram**.

##  Features

-  Push-to-Talk Voice Input  
-  Microphone Access & Audio Recording  
-  Speech-to-Text Transcription using Deepgram  
-  Transcribing Status Indicator  
-  Start / Stop Recording Controls  
-  Basic Error Handling  

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Tauri** – Cross-platform desktop framework  
- **React + TypeScript** – Frontend UI  
- **Vite** – Frontend build tool  
- **Deepgram API** – Speech-to-text transcription  
- **Node.js (Express server)** – Secure API proxy

##  Architecture Overview

```
src/
 ├─ ui/              → React UI components
 ├─ audio/           → Microphone access & audio recording logic
 ├─ transcription/   → Deepgram API integration
server.js            → Backend proxy for Deepgram API
src-tauri/           → Native Tauri configuration
```

### Design Decisions

- Audio capture is isolated from UI logic  
- Transcription logic is separated for clarity  
- Deepgram API key is kept server-side  
- UI kept minimal to prioritize functionality

##  API Key Security

Example `.env` file (ignored by Git):

```
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key_here
```
